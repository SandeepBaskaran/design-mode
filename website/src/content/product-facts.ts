      },
      {
        question: "What can I edit?",
        answer:
          "On a scriptable webpage, you can inspect elements and change layout, typography, colour, spacing, effects, motion, text and DOM structure. Design Mode records style, text, DOM and comment changes in the Changes tab. Browser-internal pages, extension stores and other protected surfaces cannot be scripted by browser extensions.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does it work on localhost and sites I'm logged into?",
        answer:
          "Yes on a normal webpage your browser can script — including localhost, staging, and pages where you are already logged in — because the editor runs in that tab. It cannot run on browser-internal pages (chrome://, about:), extension stores, or other blocked surfaces such as some enterprise policies. file:// pages need the browser's local-file permission and are not guaranteed. Cookie-authenticated apps work only while that tab is already signed in; Design Mode does not bypass login, SSO or publisher access controls. Edits are a local preview; they do not change the publisher's source.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does Design Mode change my production source code?",
        answer:
          "Not by itself. It changes the rendered page in your browser and records a structured specification. Copy as Prompt puts that specification on your clipboard. Send to Agent exposes it through MCP to a connected agent, which still needs access to your repository and must implement and verify the source-code change.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I edit a third-party website?",
        answer:
          "You can use Design Mode to make a local visual experiment on a webpage that allows extension scripts. That does not change the publisher's website or deploy anything. Reload persistence depends on the browser session and storage implementation described on the privacy page.",
      },
      {
        question: "Who is it for?",
        answer:
          "The primary workflow is for designers, design engineers and developers who use an AI coding agent: make the intended change on the rendered interface, hand the structured change to the agent, then review the source diff and rendered result. QA, content and product teams can also export precise visual feedback without asking the extension to write code.",

        question: "Which browsers are supported?",
        answer:
          "Design Mode supports current desktop Chromium browsers that provide Manifest V3 side panels, including Chrome, Edge, Brave and Arc, plus Firefox 121 or later through its native sidebar. Safari is not supported. Firefox provides the core editor; pop-out, Document Picture-in-Picture and the EyeDropper API remain Chromium-only. In Chrome, toolbar clicks and Alt+D open the launch surface selected in Settings (Side panel by default, Floating, or a Pin-on-top opener). Firefox always opens its sidebar.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I use Chrome or Firefox?",
        answer:
          "Use Chrome or another Chromium browser if you need pop-out, Picture-in-Picture or the screen eyedropper. Use Firefox if you prefer its native sidebar and do not need those three extras. The core editing surface, Changes tab and MCP hand-off are available in both builds.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is an account required?",
        answer:
          "No account is required to install or use the editor. Connecting the hosted Cloud relay creates an anonymous device credential; it does not ask for an email address or user profile.",

        question:
          "How do I communicate visual changes to Claude Code or another coding agent?",
        answer:
          "Use Copy as Prompt when you want a portable Markdown specification that you can paste anywhere. Use Send to Agent when your coding agent is connected through Design Mode's MCP server. In both cases, review the agent's source diff and the rendered result before shipping.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does the MCP server expose?",
        answer:
          "Cloud, Local and Self-hosted expose eight session tools: get_changes, apply_changes, set_change_status, clear_changes, mark_comment_resolved, get_session_summary, export_changes and get_screenshot. Local also exposes wait_for_handoff for opt-in feedback rounds with immutable per-Send snapshots and an explicit Stop. The tools read the current browser session, preview changes in the page and keep the Changes tab in sync; they do not grant an agent repository access. Cloud and Self-hosted keep one-shot Send.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which agents are supported?",
        answer:
          "Design Mode uses Model Context Protocol, so it can work with clients that support a compatible local or Streamable HTTP MCP server. Configuration files, transport support and authentication syntax differ by client and version. Use the tested, version-stamped instructions in the MCP setup documentation instead of assuming one JSON block works everywhere.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "What is the difference between Cloud, Local and Self-hosted?",
        answer:
          "Cloud is selected on a fresh install, but it makes no connection until you create a Cloud credential. Local connects the extension to the companion server on your machine. Concurrent Local clients share one owner on port 9960 by default; a surviving client takes over if the owner closes, foreign occupants are never killed, and DM_PORT selects a fallback port that must match the extension. Self-hosted points the extension and agent at relay infrastructure you operate. Cloud and Self-hosted relay messages over HTTPS; Local keeps the Design Mode transport on your machine.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I have to use MCP?",
        answer:
          "No. Copy as Prompt works without an MCP server. MCP is useful when you want the agent to fetch changes, return live previews, capture screenshots and update change status directly.",

    title: "Privacy, storage and licence",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What data leaves my machine by default?",
        answer:
          "The editor itself has no product telemetry. A fresh install selects Cloud mode but does not contact the relay until you create a Cloud credential. The marketing website may load Google Analytics when its deployment ID is configured. See the privacy page for storage, relay and website analytics details.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does the Cloud relay store data?",
        answer:
          "Relay request and response queues request a 60-second Redis expiry and responses are normally deleted as soon as they are consumed. The expiry call is separate and best-effort, so 60 seconds is not a guaranteed maximum. The server retains a SHA-256 hash of the anonymous device token, a tenant identifier and created/last-seen timestamps until the credential is revoked. Operational logs contain metadata such as tenant identifier, message type, byte count, latency, status and errors—not selectors, screenshots or payload bodies.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does Design Mode train on my edits?",
        answer:
          "Design Mode does not train a model and its relay does not send edits to a model on its own. When you deliberately hand changes to Claude, Cursor or another agent, that provider processes the content under its own account settings and privacy terms.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is Design Mode free and open source?",
        answer:
          "The extension and repository are published under the MIT licence and the current store listings are free to install. MIT permits commercial use, modification and redistribution subject to its licence notice. Future hosting or service policy should be judged from the terms published at that time rather than a promise that can never change.",
