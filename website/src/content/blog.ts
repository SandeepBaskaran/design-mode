Theme scopes, component scopes, matching @media/@supports blocks, and cascade layers are all picked up — on a Carbon Design System page that's the difference between finding no tokens and finding roughly 660 of them.",
          "Recognised systems — IBM Carbon, Material, MUI, Bootstrap, Polaris, Radix, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind v4 — get labelled by name, and any Design-tab field authored from a variable now shows a ◆ badge. Click it for Swap token… (colour, spacing, radius, typography, and shadow all get a matched picker now, not just colour), Edit token globally, or Detach from token.",
          "Because a token is one value per theme, edits write into a managed override stylesheet scoped to wherever the element actually resolves the token, instead of a single inline override that a theme scope's own rule would just beat. The agent side gets the same context: get_changes now carries tokenChanges with the scope and system, and the /design-mode workflow tells the agent to edit the token's definition, not restyle the component.",

Alongside the Firefox launch, dragging an element now snaps to alignment guides the way Slides and Keynote do, and the color picker opens in a much lighter compact form.",

          "Design Mode now installs on Firefox 121+ from Firefox Add-ons (AMO), right alongside the Chrome Web Store build. The important part: it ships from one dist/ and one merged manifest.json. There is no separate Firefox build — the same bundle serves both browsers and detects the platform at runtime, so every feature that can work on Firefox stays in lockstep with Chrome instead of drifting behind a fork.",
          "On Firefox the panel renders as the browser's native sidebar; on Chrome it's the native side panel. Alt+D opens it on both. A few things are genuinely Chrome-only because Firefox has no equivalent API — the pop-out floating window, the always-on-top Picture-in-Picture window, and the screen eyedropper — and those controls are simply hidden on Firefox rather than shown broken.",

          "Drag the body of a selected element and its edges and centres now snap to its siblings and to the parent box, with a solid magenta guide drawn through each match — the same feel as dragging a shape around in Slides or Keynote. Snapping is per-axis and composes with the existing Shift axis-lock, so you can constrain to one direction and still snap along it. Hold Alt to drag freely with snapping off, and the guides clear the moment you drop. Multi-select drags snap as a group.",

The full HSV surface is still one click away behind a Custom colour disclosure; it's just collapsed by default so the common case stays quiet.",

Escape now drops back to hover mode instead of turning inspection off. With a multi-selection active, a plain click collapses the set to the one element you clicked (Shift-click still adds). Resizing past a min/max cap now widens the cap so the element actually moves. Aligning a single flex child works. Drop shadows on text layers hug the glyphs instead of boxing the text. And the texture effect is visible again, with an Opacity control.",
