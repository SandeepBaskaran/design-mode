    metaDescription:
      "Walk a deployed app with Design Mode and log every off-spec colour, spacing, type, or radius. Export the full audit as a structured spec for engineering.",

    intro:
      "Design systems decay. Engineers under deadline reach for raw hex codes; designers hand off without checking tokens; a year later the deployed app uses 14 shades of grey. Design Mode is the fastest way to find and fix the drift.",
    problem:
      "Reading code for drift means parsing thousands of CSS rules. Reading the design system file doesn't tell you what's actually deployed. The only ground truth is the rendered page.",

        name: "Walk the deployed app",
        text: "Open key pages with Design Mode. Use the colour picker to spot non-token colours.",
